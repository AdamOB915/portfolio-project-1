### Validator Testing
  - HTML
    - A recurring error came up with the catagory buttons when tested on the W3C HTML Validator
    - Three errors came up with the form.

  - CSS
    - There were no errors found when passing through the W3C CSS Validator.

### Unfixed Bugs
  - Unable to complete Media Querys due to project deadline. With the amount of HTML files used in the project it made it near immposible to figure out each page.
  - The footer has a visable link inbetween the social media links.

## Deployment

## Credits
  - For the zoom effect of the Navigation Menu this website was used: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp
  - Images throughout the project were all found on : https://images.google.com/

## Conclusion and passing remarks
Throughout the project I have learned a huge amount about HTML and CSS. I am happy with the overall design and flow of the site. I find it really unfortunate that I could not complete the media querys section of the project but it is a mistake that I will keep in mind thorughout other projects. If I was to do this project again, instead of creating new html files for each page, I would section them and keep them on the one html page. I feel this would make the media querys alot less confusing and keep it realistic for my first ever project.
